		On this day I was messaged the goddess first time. You responed beautifully. One day I was suffering with the fever. The caring that you showed I loved alot. Your kindness towards your human beings. The way that you loved your friends and showing the caring was amazing. I don't want to loss that kind of love and caring in my life. For your cuteness I have no words to express. Your drawing are very amazing and Your search a beauiful artist chinni. I don:t know how to express my feelings towards you. I cannot express those amazing feeling in words. But one thing I want to tell you I never experience this type of feeling never before.
