		On this day exactly at 3:40 pm .<br> I saw the most beautiful goddess on the Earth. She is such a beauitiful and caring person on this earth. I have never seen a such a girl like you before in my life.The first day I saw you that beautiful moment is still scrolling in my eyes and I never forgot that moment in my life. Your gone to the library and I was waiting at the outside that was the first day I was waiting for a girl in my life and you seems to be something different which I never seen before.So I decided to know about you. On that day onwards I started following you. But I have a problem I don't know how to talk with the girls. I was struggled a lot to overcome that problem and talk with you.Until that my life is entirely different once you came into my life I am starting changing myself. That is the turning best point in my life
