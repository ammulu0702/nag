	    On this day I have a interview at 4:10 even through I don't get afraid because my heart wants to talk with you. I came to the college with so much of confidence to talk with you. But I don't know how to start the conversation. I was roaming around you and finally I found you alone. God helped me by sending you alone to your classroom while returning back from the classroom. That was the first time I talk to you while talking your beautiful voice touched my heart. Such a beautiful voice grasp my attention towards you more. After that while your going to parking that was one of the most memorable moment I still remember the words that I talked with you.
